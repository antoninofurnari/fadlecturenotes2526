    "## 1. Getting the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection is the crucial first step in any data analysis process. There are several methods to obtain data, each with its own advantages and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "Surveys are structured questionnaires used to gather information from individuals or groups. They can be conducted through various means:\n",
    "- **Paper questionnaires**: Traditional method, good for controlled environments\n",
    "- **Online forms**: Cost-effective, wide reach, easy data collection\n",
    "- **Telephone interviews**: Personal interaction, higher response rates\n",
    "- **In-person interviews**: Most detailed responses, highest quality data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics of surveys:**\n",
    "- Structured and standardized questions\n",
    "- Can be administered in various formats\n",
    "- Allow for quantifiable responses\n",
    "- Useful for collecting opinions, attitudes, and demographic information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments allow researchers to collect data in a **controlled** environment and are primarily used to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Controlled Experiments (RCTs)** are the gold standard:\n",
    "- **Controlled manipulation** of variables\n",
    "- **Random assignment** of participants to treatment groups\n",
    "- **Replicability** to test hypotheses\n",
    "- **Control groups** to isolate the effect of the treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Testing drug effectiveness\n",
    "- Population: People with a specific disease\n",
    "- Sample: Random selection of patients\n",
    "- Treatment: Half receive the drug, half receive placebo\n",
    "- Randomization: Assignment is random to avoid bias\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Observational Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Observational data collection involves passive recording of information as it naturally occurs, without interference from the researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key characteristics:**\n",
    "- No direct manipulation of variables\n",
    "- Captures data as it naturally occurs\n",
    "- Useful for studying complex, uncontrolled environments\n",
    "- Often used when experiments are unethical or impractical\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Studying the effects of smoking\n",
    "- Cannot ethically ask people to smoke\n",
    "- Observe existing smokers vs. non-smokers\n",
    "- Track health outcomes over time\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Data Collection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scraping\n",
    "Web scraping involves automatically extracting data from websites:\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Large amounts of data, automated collection\n",
    "- **Challenges**: Legal considerations, changing website structures\n",
    "- **Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "#### APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)\n",
    "APIs provide structured access to data from various services:\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Structured data, official access, real-time updates\n",
    "- **Examples**: Twitter API, Google Maps API, Weather APIs\n",
    "- **Considerations**: Rate limits, authentication requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Public Datasets\n",
    "Many organizations provide free access to datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kaggle**: \n",
    "- Largest community of data scientists\n",
    "- Competitions with real-world datasets\n",
    "- Wide variety of domains (finance, healthcare, sports, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**UCI Machine Learning Repository**:\n",
    "- Academic datasets for research\n",
    "- Well-documented and clean datasets\n",
    "- Classic datasets for learning and benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "**ISTAT (Italian National Institute of Statistics)**:\n",
    "- Official Italian government statistics\n",
    "- Demographic, economic, and social data\n",
    "- Reliable and authoritative source\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5 Sample vs Population\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distinction between sample and population is crucial for proper statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population (Ω)**:\n",
    "- The complete set of all possible observations\n",
    "- Often theoretical or too large to study entirely\n",
    "- Examples: All people in the world, all possible coin tosses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample**:\n",
    "- A subset of the population: {ω⁽¹⁾, ω⁽²⁾, ..., ω⁽ⁿ⁾} ⊆ Ω\n",
    "- Practical and manageable size\n",
    "- Should be representative of the population\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key considerations**:\n",
    "- **Sampling bias**: When the sample doesn't represent the population\n",
    "- **Sample size**: Larger samples generally provide better estimates\n",
    "- **Sampling method**: Random sampling is preferred for generalizability"

    "Represent properties that describe categories or qualities:\n",

    "#### Discrete Variables\n",
    "- Can assume a **finite** or **countably infinite** number of values\n",
    "- Often result from counting\n",

    "- **Statistics**: Mode, frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordinal Scale\n",

    "- Differences between categories are not necessarily equal\n",
    "- **Examples**: Education level (high school, bachelor's, master's), satisfaction rating (poor, fair, good, excellent)\n",
